# My GitHub

Welcome to my public GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and driven developer with a strong interest in web development and low-level graphics rendering.  While much of my current project work is private (either academic or client-based), this space showcases my general skills, explorations.

## Areas of Expertise

* **Web Development:** I'm proficient in building modern web applications, with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies.  I enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces and robust server-side logic. Alot of the content that is hidden due to privacy is focused on web based content.
* **Graphics Rendering:** I'm fascinated by the intricacies of low-level graphics programming. Particually in practice projects such as fluid sims and a recent raytracing one I did implementing octrees to increase efficiency.

## Technologies

I'm comfortable working with a range of technologies, including:

* **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vue, Angular)
* **Back-end:**  Node.js, PHP
* **Graphics:** OpenGL, Vulkan, Unity Game Engine, (Currently creating my dissertation based of OpenGL and Qt, for a simulation tool using predictive modeling)
